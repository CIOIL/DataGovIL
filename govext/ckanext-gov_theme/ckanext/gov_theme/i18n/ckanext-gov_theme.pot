" About The Data.gov.il website was established by the e-government as part of"
" an \"open government\" policy, based on promoting the transparency and "
"presentation of reliable government information authorized for public use. "
"This policy is implemented in other advanced countries in the world, such as "
"the United States, United Kingdom and Australia. In the Data.gov.il website, "
"government databases are published clearly and accessibly and are "
"continuously updated. The information system of Data.gov.il allows for quick "
"and efficient location and downloading of data, subject to the Freedom of "
"Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The Data.gov.il project was first "
"developed following a decision by the Ministerial Committee on Improving "
"Public Government Services and Open Government, on Monday, November 29, 2010."
" The project's goal is to improve the service to the public and encourage the"
" creative use of the public, the academia and of the government with the "
"government databases. The Data.gov.il site provides its users the full "
"freedom to develop applications and systems, based on the published "
"information. All information updates to the databases will be automatically "
"available to applications based on them. About E-government E-government is "
"responsible for providing the services and information offered online to the "
"public, in order to improve the communication between citizens and government"
" institutions. E-government operates under the Prime Minister's office, under"
" which operate the Gov.IL portal, Government Payment Service, Government "
"Forms Service and more. "
